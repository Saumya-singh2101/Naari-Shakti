**Naari Shakti**

A Privacy-First Platform for Women’s Safety, Support, and Empowerment

**Overview**

Naari Shakti is a socially driven digital platform designed to help women—especially those in informal, contract-based, and low-resource work environments—take the first safe step toward support when facing workplace harassment.

The platform focuses on empowerment before enforcement, bridging the gap between experiencing harassment and accessing help, guidance, or legal pathways.

**Problem Statement
**
Despite the presence of workplace protection laws, harassment remains underreported due to:

Fear of retaliation and job loss

Power imbalances

Social stigma

Lack of accessible, trusted reporting mechanisms

This gap is most severe in informal and Tier 2/Tier 3 work settings.

Solution

Naari Shakti provides a safe, anonymous, and accessible space where women can:

Seek guidance without revealing identity

Access safety and emergency support

Understand their rights in simple, actionable language

Connect with trusted guardians, NGOs, and support organizations

The platform is pre-legal, meaning it does not deliver justice or enforcement, but prepares and empowers women to approach formal systems confidently if they choose to.
